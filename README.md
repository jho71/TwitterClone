## Use Instructions

npm i // install all dependencies

Note: there is no external database connected, just a local array storing user objects, by reloading the user will disappear from memory.

This web app backend is built primarily with Node.js, Express, bcrytp, express-sessions and Passport.

## My favourite part of this project

I enjoyed this assignment becasue it allowed me use the skills I already have in backend development to build something smaller in scope with good code design, documentation and functionality. Also I am proud that the code I wrote is resilient and ecrytpion protected, ensuring that users are safe when thier passwords are used and stored by a database. Moreover, if you are interested, there is proof of my skilles with building API's in my portfolio (code repositories can be found here: [a link] (https://jho71.github.io/johnho/). Specifically, my web app DictionAny is powered by an API that I built. The API supports over 30+ unique queries including creating, reading, updating, deletion, and like/unlike (similar to the assignment), the code can be found at [a link] (https://github.com/jho71/DictionAnyAPI).

I'm ethusiastic to use my backend skills to contribute to the LeapGrad team!
